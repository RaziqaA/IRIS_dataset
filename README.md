# IRIS_Dataset

 Overview 

This project involves analyzing the famous Iris dataset, which is often usedfor  machine learning tasks. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample classified into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of this project is to explore the data and apply classification algorithms to predict the species of an iris based on its features.



## Dataset Information

Dataset Source: This Dataset is drawn from Kaggle

Number of Instances: 150

Number of Features: -> sepal length, sepalwidth, petallength, petalwidth 4 in Number

## Documentation

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   Distribution of species in the dataset

   Correlation between features

  Visualizations :

  1]  scatter plots

  2] histograms

  3]  violin plots

  4]  box plots.


* Machine Learning Model

  I have made use of  the Decision Tree Algorithm( Accuracy:    100%)
  The models were evaluated using cross-validation and confusion matrices to measure performance.


 * Results


   The Random forest classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 100%, successfully predicting the species based on the four features of the flowers. The Decision Tree model also gave competitive results with a slightly lower accuracy.
